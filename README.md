Archimedes Finance!

We build in public - so here is how we do stuff in

- Our eng team processes: https://docs.archimedesfi.com/core-engineering-team/
- The CTO scratch book: https://docs.archimedesfi.com/archimedes-finance-the-ctos-scratch-book/

Common issues

- "ProviderError: Must be authenticated!": related to git hub private repo not being able to be checked out. One simple fix is to clone secrets repo inside this folder to have root/secrets
